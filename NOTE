This code was written with help, following along lsh's developer "brenns10" on GitHub's tutorial intro to shell creation.
I appreciate his resource(s) and wish to extend thanks his way for being an excellent member of the code ecosystem.
Most of the code in qish is borrowed in concept, some lines directly lifted (formatted differently to fit my preferred bracing style) and spliced in. A huge majority is his documentation.
However, as he states in his lsh's README.md, lsh (and the tutorial) was intended to be a base to work off of for people wishing to learn (a) shell framework.
